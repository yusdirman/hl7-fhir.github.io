{"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode"}]},"contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"other","value":"http://hl7.org"}]}],"date":"2016-03-23","description":" A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.  Constraints:\r\nThe kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems.  The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc. Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure. Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code \"potassium\" together with and Act.classCode for \"laboratory observation\" to somehow mean \"potassium laboratory observation\" and then use the same Act.code for \"potassium\" together with Act.classCode for \"medication\" to mean \"substitution of potassium\". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.","experimental":false,"id":"v3-ActCode","meta":{"lastUpdated":"2016-03-23T00:00:00.000+00:00","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-shareable-definition"]},"name":"v3 Code System ActCode","publisher":"HL7, Inc","resourceType":"ValueSet","status":"active","text":{"div":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Release Date: 2016-03-23</p>\r\n<table class=\"grid\">\r\n <tr><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Code</b></td><td><b>Display</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>C<a name=\"C\"> </a></td><td>corrected</td><td>\n                        \n                           Description:Indicates that result data has been corrected.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>DIET<a name=\"DIET\"> </a></td><td>Diet</td><td>\n                        Code set to define specialized/allowed diets<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>DRUGPRG<a name=\"DRUGPRG\"> </a></td><td>drug program</td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A public or government health program that administers and funds coverage for prescription drugs to assist program eligible who meet financial and health status criteria.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>F<a name=\"F\"> </a></td><td>final</td><td>\n                        \n                           Description:Indicates that a result is complete.

Like an HMO, a POS plan encourages the use its HMO network to maintain discounted fees with participating providers, but recognizes that sometimes covered parties want to choose their own provider.  The POS plan allows a covered party to use providers who are not part of the HMO network (non-participating providers).  However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers. A covered party will usually pay deductibles and coinsurances that are substantially higher than the payments when he or she uses a plan provider. Use of non-participating providers often requires the covered party to pay the provider directly and then to file a claim for reimbursement, like in an FFS plan.<br/>\r\n\n

In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals.  Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party.  For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of  a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>PNC<a name=\"PNC\"> </a></td><td>property and casualty insurance policy</td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A type of insurance that covers damage to or loss of the policyholderaTMs property by providing payments for damages to property damage or the injury or death of living subjects.

Thus the risk of loss is spread and a disproportionately large loss under a single policy does not fall on one insurance company. Acceptance by an insurer, called a reinsurer, of all or part of the risk of loss of another insurance company.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: Reinsurance is a means by which an insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses with other insurance companies. Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.<br/>\r\n\n                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies. Also called risk control insurance or stop-loss insurance.\n                        <br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>SURPL<a name=\"SURPL\"> </a></td><td>surplus line insurance policy</td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: \n                        <br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              A risk or part of a risk for which there is no normal insurance market available.<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Insurance written by unauthorized insurance companies.
