 <tr><td>Definition:</td><td> A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.  Constraints:
The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems.  The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc. Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure. Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code &quot;potassium&quot; together with and Act.classCode for &quot;laboratory observation&quot; to somehow mean &quot;potassium laboratory observation&quot; and then use the same Act.code for &quot;potassium&quot; together with Act.classCode for &quot;medication&quot; to mean &quot;substitution of potassium&quot;. This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.</td></tr>

                           Discussion: Managed care policies are offered by managed care plans that contract with selected providers or health care organizations to provide comprehensive health care at a discount to covered parties and coordinate the financing and delivery of health care. Managed care uses medical protocols and procedures agreed on by the medical profession to be cost effective, also known as medical practice guidelines.

However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers. A covered party will usually pay deductibles and coinsurances that are substantially higher than the payments when he or she uses a plan provider. Use of non-participating providers often requires the covered party to pay the provider directly and then to file a claim for reimbursement, like in an FFS plan.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode-HMO"> </a><a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#HMO">HMO</a></td><td>health maintenance organization policy</td><td>Definition: A policy for a health plan that provides coverage for health care only through contracted or employed physicians and hospitals located in particular geographic or service areas.

In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals.  Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party.  For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.

                        
                           Discussion:A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of  a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode-ANNU"> </a><a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#ANNU">ANNU</a></td><td>annuity policy</td><td>Definition: A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.

Thus the risk of loss is spread and a disproportionately large loss under a single policy does not fall on one insurance company. Acceptance by an insurer, called a reinsurer, of all or part of the risk of loss of another insurance company.

                        
                           Discussion: Reinsurance is a means by which an insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses with other insurance companies. Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.

                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies. Also called risk control insurance or stop-loss insurance.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode-SURPL"> </a><a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#SURPL">SURPL</a></td><td>surplus line insurance policy</td><td>Definition:

                           Usage Note: If the grantor's term of agreement must be accepted in full, then this is considered &quot;basic consent&quot;.  If a grantee is offered an opportunity to extend or restrict certain terms, then the agreement is considered &quot;granular consent&quot;.

                           Usage Note: Implied or &quot;implicit&quot; consent with an &quot;opportunity to dissent&quot; occurs when the grantor's behavior is understood by a reasonable person to signal assent to the grantee's terms of agreement whether the grantor requests or the grantee approves further restrictions, is considered &quot;granular consent&quot;.

                        
                           Examples: 
                        

                        
                           Healthcare Examples: A healthcare provider deems a patient's assent to disclosure of health information to family members and friends, but offers an opportunity or permits the patient to dissent to such disclosures.

                           Usage Note: The grantee's terms of agreement, may be available to the grantor by reviewing the grantee's privacy policies, but there is no notice by which a grantor is apprised of the policy directly or able to acknowledge.

                        
                           Examples: 
                        

                        
                           Healthcare: Without notification or an opportunity to assent or dissent, a patient's health information is automatically included in and available (often according to certain rules) through a health information exchange.  Note that this differs from implied consent, where the patient is assumed to have consented.
                           Without notification or an opportunity to assent or dissent, a patient's health information is collected, accessed, used, or disclosed for research, public health, security, fraud prevention, court order, or law enforcement.

Security category metadata is defined by ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998(E/F)/ T-REC-X.812-1995 as: &quot;A nonhierarchical grouping of sensitive information used to control access to data more finely than with hierarchical security classification alone.&quot;

                        
                           Rationale: A security category observation supports requirement to specify the type of IT resource to facilitate application of appropriate levels of information security according to a range of levels of impact or consequences that might result from the unauthorized disclosure, modification, or use of the information or information system.  A resource is assigned to a specific category of information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security management) defined by an organization or in some instances, by a specific law, Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation. [FIPS 199]

                        
                           Examples: Types of security categories include:

                        
                           Compartment:  A division of data into isolated blocks with separate security controls for the purpose of reducing risk. (ISO 2382-8).  A security label tag that &quot;segments&quot; an IT resource by indicating that access and use is restricted to members of a defined community or project. (HL7 Healthcare Classification System)  
                           Sensitivity:  The characteristic of an IT resource which implies its value or importance and may include its vulnerability. (ISO 7492-2)  Privacy metadata for information perceived as undesirable to share.  (HL7 Healthcare Classification System)</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode-SECCLASSOBS"> </a><a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#SECCLASSOBS">SECCLASSOBS</a></td><td>security classification observation</td><td>Type of security metadata observation made about the classification of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions.  Security classification is defined by ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998(E/F)/ T-REC-X.812-1995 as: &quot;The determination of which specific degree of protection against access the data or information requires, together with a designation of that degree of protection.&quot;  Security classification metadata is based on an analysis of applicable policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm that could result from unauthorized disclosure.

                        
                           Rationale: A security classification observation may indicate that the confidentiality level indicated by an Act or Role confidentiality attribute has been overridden by the entity responsible for ascribing the SecurityClassificationObservationValue.  This supports the business requirement for increasing or decreasing the level of confidentiality (classification or declassification) based on parameters beyond the original assignment of an Act or Role confidentiality.

                        
                           Examples: Types of security classification include: HL7 Confidentiality Codes such as very restricted, unrestricted, and normal.  Intelligence community examples include top secret, secret, and confidential.

                        
                           Usage Note: Security classification observation type codes designate security label field types, which are valued with an applicable SecurityClassificationObservationValue code as the &quot;security label tag&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode-SECCONOBS"> </a><a href="../../v3/ActCode/cs.html#SECCONOBS">SECCONOBS</a></td><td>security control observation</td><td>Type of security metadata observation made about the control of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make access control decisions.  Security control metadata convey instructions to users and receivers for secure distribution, transmission, and storage; dictate obligations or mandated actions; specify any action prohibited by refrain policy such as dissemination controls; and stipulate the permissible purpose of use of an IT resource.  

                        
                           Rationale: A security control observation supports requirement to specify applicable management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [FIPS 199]

                        
                           Examples: Types of security control metadata include:
