This category includes observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures excluding lab and imaging (e.g. cardiology catheterization, endoscopy, electrodiagnostics, etc.).  Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.</td>
