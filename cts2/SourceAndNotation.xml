  <description value="A description of the source from which the ResourceVersionDescription was derived. When possible, SourceAndNotation should include a reference to the actual source document from which it was
				derived. As an example, if the resource was derived from the W3C Wine Ontology, the URI http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-owl-guide-20030818/wine would unambiguously name the document. In the cases, however, when a definitive
				source document is not available, a textual description should be provided, instead, in sourceAndNotationDescription. Where possible, the ontology language and ontology syntax should also be provided. In the case of
				the Wine Ontology above, the ontology language would be http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl# (OWL) and the syntax would be application/rdf+xml."/>
