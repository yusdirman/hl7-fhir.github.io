         <h2><span class="sectioncount">A.4.1</span> Purpose <a href="uslabphreport-guide.html#purpose" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="../target.png"/></a></h2>
         <p>
            The FHIR USLab Public Health Report (FHIR ELR) Implementation (FHIR ELR) is based upon the <a href="uslabreport-guide.html">USLab Report Implementation</a> and repeats most of that content here as well as the additional requirements, specifications and standards, and on providing the implementation guidance needed to transmit reportable laboratory observations to appropriate US local, state, territorial and federal health agencies using  using <a href="../http.html">FHIR in the RESTful framework</a>.  FHIR ELR facilitates the inclusion of information necessary for public health reporting in the larger test order - test result process between ordering providers/laboratories and performing laboratories to ensure that the data is available to be sent to PH when necessary. Harmonizing the technical specifications (format and vocabulary) for the test order (order placer sends order to lab), test result (lab sends result to order placer), and reportable test result (lab sends result to PH) enhances interoperability and data quality thus improving the overall laboratory result reporting process for both the sender and the receiver.
         </p>
         <p>This implementation is not specific to any pathogen or reportable condition and is applicable for most biological and chemistry reportable laboratory observations. Each state and territory has requirements for laboratories to report certain findings to health officials. Authority to establish a list of reportable conditions and to specify the content of those reports resides with the individual public health jurisdiction. Reports made to Public Health come in two forms: case reports (not the subject of this guide), and laboratory reports related to reportable conditions.  Reporters can access further information about reportable conditions at the website for their own Public Health jurisdiction relevant to their service area.   Additionally, this implementation does not replace the need for each public health jurisdiction to document additional constraints of their specific implementation.</p>

            the base HL7 V2.5.1 Standard to determine how these optional message elements will be used.
            Conformance information is provided when a conditional predicate resolves to an "R" or "RE" on
            either the "a" or "b" part of the expression, regardless of the opposite value, e.g., C(R/O). -->
           <!-- EH not needed : This guide provides conditional predicates for some fields; note that the condition may be dependent

            should be "if the optional element is used, then these additional constraints are now required." That
            is, if the optional element is present, then these additional constraints are now active. This guidance
            is included as it is logically true but these conditional elements are not tested. -->
           <!-- EH not needed : This guide uses "X" as a conformance usage indicator very sparingly. Where the underlying standard

            for the use case have been given the "X" usage. All other message elements have either been further
            constrained to R/RE/C(a/b) or have been left as "O" to enable trading partners to explore additional
            capabilities. Note that without a clearly agreed to complementary profile between trading partners,
            an EHR that is compliant with this implementation guide does not have to send any elements marked
            as an "O", nor does a receiver of a lab order that is compliant with this implementation guide have to
            process any elements marked as an "O". Neither trading partner can mandate the other to accept any
            such complementary profiles to enable basic laboratory orders interfacing "out-of-the-box". -->

         <p>This guide uses FHIR profiles on the following resource to define a minimum set of requirements to enable the
            successful exchange of laboratory orders:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>DiagnosticOrder</li>
            <li>DiagnosticReport</li>
            <li>Organization</li>

            <li>Specimen</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            The main objective is to ensure that EHR systems and
            Laboratory systems can exchange laboratory orders with minimum if any modifications from one
            combination to another combination of software, while maintaining flexibility to enable software
            developers to provide more capabilities using the same core Resource definitions.

         <p>This guide calls for specific vocabulary standards for the exchange of laboratory information such as
            LOINC and SNOMED. Standard vocabularies, particularly coded laboratory tests and their results,
            enable automated decision support for patient healthcare, as well as for public health surveillance of
            populations. Value Sets resource are provided as part of this implementation.

         <p>
            FHIR only functions using snapshot mode - updates are communicated by sending a complete copy of the instance with the new data filled in.  If a correction and/or status update to Observation Resource is necessary, the DiagnosticReport with all references to all Observation Resource, even if previously
            sent, shall be resent with the correction and/or current status and/or current values. For example,
            when a Complete Blood Count with manual differential is ordered, the blood count will be released
            and then at a later time the manual differential will be performed and released. When the blood count
            is released the DiagnosticReport will reference only the Observation Resources for the count as final results. When the differential is completed,
            the DiagnosticReport will reference all previous Observation Resources as well as the new Observation resources -  in this case the blood
            count and the differential results.

           <!-- EH not needed: The base standard indicates that receiving applications "�shall process (save/print/archive/etc.)�". For
            order-specific segments, e.g., ORC, OBR, SPM, this typically means saving that data. For other
            segments, e.g., MSH, the receiving application may not always have to save the data as the segment is
            focused on ensuring the order-specific data arrives in the appropriate place and therefore may have
            shorter-term value. -->
         <p>Due to receiving system variations and need, this guide does not specifically indicate for each field
            whether to store it or not. This is left to the individual system's scope and purpose.

            A Provider (orderer) may enter a laboratory order into an ambulatory DSS. A laboratory
            requisition is generated (paper or electronic) and is communicated to the laboratory. The information
            in the laboratory requisition is entered manually or captured electronically into the LIS. After the
            specimen(s) has been collected and, if necessary, shipped or delivered to the laboratory, the
            laboratory processes the specimen(s). If the specimen is satisfactory for testing the laboratory will
            perform the test. Prior to successful completion of a test, communication may also be necessary to
            indicate cancellation, failure to perform the test and the related reasons; for example if the specimen

         <p>The following <a href="http://www.clsi.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/HarmonizedTerminologyDatabase/Harmonized_Terminolo.htm">definitions <img src="../external.png" style="text-align: baseline"/></a> were derived from the CLSI website:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <b>QUANTITATIVE </b>
               <ul>
                  <li>A characterization applied to laboratory tests that give results expressing a numerical amount
                     or level (concentration) of an analyte in a specimen; <br/>
                     NOTE 1: It is usually compared to an accredited recognized standard;  <br/>
                     NOTE 2: This is in contrast to qualitative tests.
                  </li>
                  <li>When used to describe a test, means a test that produces a result that is numerical. For
                     example, a point-of-care blood glucose test might generate a result of 120 mg/dL (1.20 g/L).
                     In contrast, a qualitative test generates a non-numerical result such as 'positive' or 'detected.'
                     A subset of quantitative tests called semiquantitative provides results either over a range of
                     values, such as a urine dipstick that results in glucose ranges of 0-40, 40-100, and &gt;100
                     mg/dL (0-0.4, 0.4-1, and &gt;1 g/L), or as a series of relative values, such as the same multiple
                     test urine dipstick that results in hemoglobin as 0, +, ++, +++, and ++++.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>QUALITATIVE </b>
               <ul>
                  <li>When used to describe a test, means a test that produces a result that is descriptive rather than
                     numerical. For example, a urine pregnancy test might generate a result of 'positive' or 'negative'
                     for urinary hCG. In contrast, a quantitative test generates a numerical result. The quality control
                     and reporting procedures differ significantly for quantitative and qualitative tests.
                  </li>
                  <li>Characterization applied to laboratory tests that detect and/or identify a particular analyte,
                     constituent, or condition;  <br/>
                     NOTE 1: This term is applied to tests that detect whether a particular analyte, constituent, or
                     condition is present or absent, and is sometimes assigned a positive degree (i.e., 1+, 2+);  <br/>
                     NOTE 2: It may also be called semiquantitative tests;  <br/>
                     NOTE 3: Specific identification may be performed.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>SEMI-QUANTITATIVE</b>
               <ul>
                  <li>A test that has a dose-response gradient that may be included in the reported result, but for which
                     no authoritative calibration scale exists to determine inaccuracy and imprecision; tests that yield
                     results in an approximate range of values (e.g., trace, moderate);  <br/>
                     NOTE: This definition includes tests with subjective readout of quantification such as IF-ANA
                     titers, and it includes tests with an instrumental readout of quantification such as ELISA-ANA
                     when the instrument scale cannot be referenced to an authoritative calibration scale.
                  </li>
                  <li>Tests that yield results in an approximate range of values (e.g., trace, moderate).</li>

         <ul>
            <li><b>Analyte:  </b>Component represented in the name of a measurable quantity. It is the most granular level at which
               measurements are made and always represented using a single Observation segment group
            </li>
            <li><b>Cancellation:  </b>Act of cancelling the order. </li>
            <li><b>Electronic Health Record:  </b>Clinical information for a specific patient that is stored electronically within an EHR-S.
               Electronic Health Record
               System (EHR-S)
               This IG uses this term in the same context as stated in the &quot;HL7 EHR System Functional Model White
               Paper&quot; Section 4 Definitions (HL7 2004 www.hl7.org):
               &quot;It is important to note that the DSTU does not attempt to establish another definition for EHR Systems,
               but chooses to utilize existing definitions that include the concept of EHR Systems as a system (at least
               one) or a system-of- systems that cooperatively meet the needs of the end user.&quot;
            </li>
            <li><b>Future Order:  </b>A future order is an order with a start date/time where that start date/time indicates the earliest time the
               specimen can be collected.
            </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory:  </b>A facility or organization that performs laboratory testing on specimens for the purpose of providing
               information for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment of disease or impairment, or assessment of health for
               humans.
               Laboratory Information
               System (LIS)
               An information system that receives, processes, and stores information related to laboratory processes.
               LIS may interface with HIS and EHR applications.
               This definition is very minimal and omits many features and capabilities that are typically associated with
               laboratory information systems. This minimal characterization is intentional, as to include the broadest
               possible set of LIS systems in the use case. The minimal nature of the definition by no means excludes
               LIS with significantly greater capabilities.
            </li>
              <!-- EH - do we need this here? <li><b>Laboratory Message:  </b>An electronic communication between a Laboratory Order System and a Laboratory Information System
               related to laboratory testing. Laboratory messages may be used to request that one or more tests be
               performed, to change previous requests for testing, to report the cancellation of requested tests, or to
               report the results of requested tests.
               </li> -->
            <li><b>Laboratory Order:  </b>a DiagnosticOrder Resource item requesting  one or more measurements (Observation Resources). Synonymous with a Requisition when referring to a single DiagnosticOrder Resource item. </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory Order System:  </b>Software, either stand-alone or as part of an EHR system, used by a Provider (Order Placer) to 			manage a  laboratory order, including generating the laboratory requisition and sending it to a laboratory.
               Typically a laboratory order system is an integral part of an order management system that enables users
               to manage orders for many different types of services, procedures, supplies, etc. Since this guide only
               focuses on data exchange relative to laboratory orders it is purposely using a very limited definition.
            </li>
            <li><b>Laboratory Requisition:  </b>A set of information that constitutes an official request for one or more laboratory tests to be performed on
               an individual patient. A laboratory requisition is specified in a clinical setting and communicated to a
               laboratory as a discrete paper or electronic artifact. Laboratory requisitions always include at least one
               test order. In terms of a FHIR order transaction it represents one or more DiagnosticOrders Resource item(s).
            </li>
            <li>
               <b>Newborn:  </b>The precise cutoff when a patient is considered a newborn or an infant is subject to interpretation and this
               guide does not intend to provide a definitive answer to that. For further background the reader is directed
               to the following resources:
               <ul>

               </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Orderable Test:  </b>A request to perform an individual test or panel. It always refers to a single  DiagnosticOrder Resource item. and 		may have one or more associated analytes (observations).
            </li>
            <li><b>Panel:  </b>While there are differences in the meanings of the terms &quot;panel&quot; among various laboratories, for the
               purposes of this guide, it is defined as a grouping of procedures that measure multiple analytes from a
               single specimen (or multiple specimens in some cases) and can be requested through one laboratory
               order. This is also referred to as a battery. For example, a CBC or a urinalysis may be referred to as a
               panel.
            </li>
            <li><b>Order Set:  </b>A set of laboratory orders that involve multiple tests and panels and that may require multiple specimens,
               but can be requested as a single unit for convenience. For example, a &quot;diabetic order set profile&quot; might
               include a CBC, a glycosylated hemoglobin test, and a urinalysis. The term &quot;panel&quot; is frequently used
               interchangeably with &quot;order set&quot;, thus an order set profile that contains a variety of laboratory test orders
               that may be on its own or be combined with other test orders (e.g., radiology image, consult, etc.) can be
               considered an order set. Order sets shall not be communicated to the laboratory.
               Request for Cancellation
               (RFC)
               Request by the Provider (Order Placer) not to perform the order.
            </li>
            <li><b>Test:  </b>A medical procedure or named set of related procedures that involves analyzing one analyte using a
               single sample of blood, urine, or other specimen from a patient for the purpose of diagnosing a disease or
               medical condition, planning or evaluating treatment, or monitoring the course of a disease.
