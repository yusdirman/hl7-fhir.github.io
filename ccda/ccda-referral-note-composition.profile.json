The information in this document includes the reason for the referral and additional information that would augment decision making and care delivery.\n\nExamples of referral situations are when a patient is referred from a family physician to a cardiologist for cardiac evaluation or when patient is sent by a cardiologist to an emergency department for angina or when a patient is referred by a nurse practitioner to an audiologist for hearing screening or when a patient is referred by a hospitalist to social services.",
