While a Composition defines the structure, it does not actually contain the content: rather the full content of a document is contained in a Bundle, of which the Composition is the first resource contained.&quot;,
        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;While the focus of this specification is on patient-specific clinical statements, this resource can also apply to other healthcare-related statements such as study protocol designs, healthcare invoices and other activities that are not necessarily patient-specific or clinical.&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;Asserting this rule set restricts the content to be only understood by a limited set of trading partners. This inherently limits the usefulness of the data in the long term. However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally computable sense. Wherever possible, implementers and/or specification writers should avoid using this element as much as possible.&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;Language is provided to support indexing and accessibility (typically, services such as text to speech use the language tag).

The language tag on the resource may be used to specify the language of other presentations generated from the data in the resource  Not all the content has to be in the base language. The Resource.language should not be assumed to apply to the narrative automatically. If a language is specified, it should it also be specified on the div element in the html (see rules in HTML5 for information about the relationship between xml:lang and the html lang attribute).&quot;,

The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it \&quot;clinically safe\&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.&quot;,

        &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element, and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.&quot;,
        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;The title identifies the section for a human reader. The title must be consistent with the narrative of the resource that is the target of the section.content reference. Generally, sections SHOULD have titles, but in some documents it is unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, this is where a section has subsections that have their own adequately distinguishing title,  or documents that only have a single section. Most Implementation Guides will make section title to be a required element.&quot;,

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.&quot;,

The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;The title identifies the section for a human reader. The title must be consistent with the narrative of the resource that is the target of the section.content reference. Generally, sections SHOULD have titles, but in some documents it is unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, this is where a section has subsections that have their own adequately distinguishing title,  or documents that only have a single section. Most Implementation Guides will make section title to be a required element.&quot;,

These values are taken into account when prioritizing all problems and their treatments.\r\nBeliefs may include comfort with dying or the refusal of blood transfusions because of the patient’s religious convictions.\r\nPreferences may include liquid medicines over tablets, or treatment via secure email instead of in person.\r\nCare expectations may range from being treated only by female clinicians, to expecting all calls to be returned within 24 hours.\r\nOverarching goals described in this section are not tied to a specific condition, problem, health concern, or intervention.

The common notion of \&quot;procedure\&quot; is broader than that specified by the HL7 Version 3 Reference Information Model (RIM), therefore this section contains procedure templates represented with three RIM classes: Act. Observation, and Procedure. Procedure act is for procedures that alter the physical condition of a patient (e.g., splenectomy). Observation act is for procedures that result in new information about a patient but do not cause physical alteration (e.g., EEG). Act is for all other types of procedures (e.g., dressing change).&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;The title identifies the section for a human reader. The title must be consistent with the narrative of the resource that is the target of the section.content reference. Generally, sections SHOULD have titles, but in some documents it is unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, this is where a section has subsections that have their own adequately distinguishing title,  or documents that only have a single section. Most Implementation Guides will make section title to be a required element.&quot;,

The title must be consistent with the narrative of the resource that is the target of the section.content reference. Generally, sections SHOULD have titles, but in some documents it is unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, this is where a section has subsections that have their own adequately distinguishing title,  or documents that only have a single section. Most Implementation Guides will make section title to be a required element.&quot;,

All active, incomplete, or pending orders, appointments, referrals, procedures, services, or any other pending event of clinical significance to the current care of the patient should be listed.\r\nThis section may also contain information about ongoing care of the patient, clinical reminders, patient’s values, beliefs, preferences, care expectations, and overarching care goals.\r\nClinical reminders are placed here to provide prompts for disease prevention and management, patient safety, and healthcare quality improvements, including widely accepted performance measures.\r\nValues may include the importance of quality of life over longevity. These values are taken into account when prioritizing all problems and their treatments.\r\nBeliefs may include comfort with dying or the refusal of blood transfusions because of the patient’s religious convictions.\r\nPreferences may include liquid medicines over tablets, or treatment via secure email instead of in person.\r\nCare expectations may range from being treated only by female clinicians, to expecting all calls to be returned within 24 hours.\r\nOverarching goals described in this section are not tied to a specific condition, problem, health concern, or intervention. Examples of overarching goals could be to minimize pain or dependence on others, or to walk a daughter down the aisle for her marriage.\r\nThe plan may also indicate that patient education will be provided.&quot;,

The section should include notable procedures, but can contain all procedures for the period of time being summarized. The common notion of \&quot;procedure\&quot; is broader than that specified by the HL7 Version 3 Reference Information Model (RIM), therefore this section contains procedure templates represented with three RIM classes: Act. Observation, and Procedure. Procedure act is for procedures that alter the physical condition of a patient (e.g., splenectomy). Observation act is for procedures that result in new information about a patient but do not cause physical alteration (e.g., EEG). Act is for all other types of procedures (e.g., dressing change).&quot;,
