These values are taken into account when prioritizing all problems and their treatments.\r\nBeliefs may include comfort with dying or the refusal of blood transfusions because of the patient’s religious convictions.\r\nPreferences may include liquid medicines over tablets, or treatment via secure email instead of in person.\r\nCare expectations may range from being treated only by female clinicians, to expecting all calls to be returned within 24 hours.\r\nOverarching goals described in this section are not tied to a specific condition, problem, health concern, or intervention.
